## Features
- FPS controller script
- Weapon does not clip into walls
- "non-resetting" weapon recoil

## Issues
- Screen Space Reflections (SSR) makes the gun invisible when applied to the gun camera (work-a-round would be to make the gun camera have a separate environment from the world environment with SSR disabled) (but I still want to know why SSR is doing this in the first place)
